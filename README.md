# Sophie

> **Transforming ideas into practical reality through natural conversation**

**Sophie** is an AI-powered product design mentor - an independent CLI system with persistent memory, multi-project support, and natural conversational interaction.

Named for the wisdom of transforming understanding into action, Sophie is your collaborative partner in product design, UX research, strategy, and design leadership.

## 🔄 Evolution Notice

**This repository has evolved:**
- **Was:** Product Design Agent (Claude Desktop / Gemini Gems implementation)
- **Now:** Sophie (Independent CLI implementation)

**The original implementation is preserved** in [`/archive/original-claude-desktop-agent/`](archive/original-claude-desktop-agent/) for reference and historical use.

Sophie is a **completely separate AI agent** - not an extension of the original, but a new implementation built from the ground up with lessons learned.

## What Makes Sophie Different

Unlike traditional AI tools, Sophie:

- **Remembers your journey** — Conversations, decisions, and context persist across sessions
- **Manages multiple projects** — Switch seamlessly between different initiatives
- **Speaks your language** — Fluent English/Spanish, natural conversation (no commands)
- **Brings expertise** — 12 specialized personas (Strategy, Research, AI, Leadership, etc.)
- **Adapts to you** — Learns your preferences, respects your constraints
- **Runs independently** — CLI-based, OAuth-authenticated, no API keys needed
- **Integrates external knowledge** — Collaborate with Perplexity AI, Claude, and other tools

---

## The Vision

Sophie represents a transformation from context-dependent web agents to an independent, memory-enabled CLI system that preserves the collaborative "soul" while adding:

✨ **Persistent Memory** — Never lose context, conversations, or decisions
✨ **Multi-Project Support** — Work on many projects with isolated contexts
✨ **External Knowledge Integration** — Bring research from Perplexity, other AIs
✨ **Provider Independence** — Works with Claude Code CLI, Gemini CLI (OAuth)
✨ **Natural Conversation** — Pure natural language, like talking to a mentor

## Current Status

**🎯 Current Focus: Phase 0 - Technology Validation**

Sophie is in active development using an **AI-first methodology** (built BY AI, guided by user).

**Phase 0: Technology Validation (2-6 days)**
- **Goal:** Choose technology stack (Deno vs Go)
- **Deliverables:** Working prototypes, comparison document, decision
- **Status:** Deno prototype in progress, Go prototype pending

**Completed:**
- ✅ Repository transformation (original agent archived at `/archive/`)
- ✅ Architectural design (138KB across 5 comprehensive documents)
- ✅ Five Cornerstones framework established
- ✅ Validation framework with automated enforcement (GitHub Actions)
- ✅ AI-first development methodology documented
- ✅ Branch strategy and project structure defined

**Next Phases:**
- **Phase 1:** Foundation (CLI, config, basic conversation)
- **Phase 2:** Orchestration (task matching, knowledge loading)
- **Phase 3-6:** AI integration → Memory layer → Enhancements → Polish

## The Journey

This project began as the **Product Design Agent** — a sophisticated file-based AI mentorship system for Claude Desktop and Gemini Gems (see [`/archive/`](archive/original-claude-desktop-agent/) for original implementation).

**The Challenge:**
Platform constraints (session limits, no memory, token usage) prevented the original agent from reaching its full potential.

**The Solution:**
Complete transformation into Sophie - an independent CLI application built from the ground up as a **separate AI agent** with:
- Persistent memory across sessions
- Multi-project workflows
- External knowledge integration
- Provider-agnostic architecture

**The Name:**
Sophie — inspired by wisdom, understanding, and the transformation of ideas into practical reality.

**Important:** Sophie does not reuse or extend the original agent's knowledge base. She's her own AI agent, designed fresh with lessons learned from the original.
